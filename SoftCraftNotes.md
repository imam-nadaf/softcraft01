Build Lifecycle

validate -> resource -> compile -> test -> package -> deploy
              1. main resource  1. main class
              2. test resources  2. test classes

validate pom.xml, copy main resources, compile main java, copy test resource, compile test java, run test, jar, install, deploy

maven frequently used commands
1. mvn clean compile --> cleans the target folder and recompile everything
2. mvn clean compile -DskipTests --> cleans the target folder and recompile main classes excluding test
3. mvn clean compile -U --> clean compile, force download dependenciË€es
4. mcn dependency:tree --> list down dependencies as a tree depicting transient dependencies
